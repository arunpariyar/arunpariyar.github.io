                        <p>I am currently in the process of rekindling my long strayed love affair with web technology. </p>
                        <p>After the completion of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Networks, I returned home to Nepal. During my time in Nepal I ventured to innovate our family business and later pursued onto establishing a successful adventure travel company. Sure I made use of tech on the way and ....oh ! found success but that wasn’t enough to be truly happy.</p> 
                        <p>Having moved to Berlin I am now picking up from where I left off 6 years ago, aiming at web development and finding true happiness along the way.</p>

                                <p>The main changes I brought to the business were:</p>

                                    <li>Improving and moving financial records from traditional to digital format</li>
                                    <li> Integrating local travel services to the company, this was a benefit we provided to customers staying at the business.</li>
                                    <li>Providing financial support for staff training, this helped to improve the quality of service provided by the business.</li>
                                    <li>Integrating a transportation facility for the customers.</li>
                                    <li>Moving from an internal to an external front office, which made it easily accessible for passersby and thus improved customer interaction.</li>
                                    <li>Improving the branding by maintaining consistency in all external/internal signage including business stationery.</li>

                                <p>The changes brought in new customers and increased customer retention. What I loved when helping customers was to hear them say, <nobr>"We love it and will come back !".</nobr></p>
